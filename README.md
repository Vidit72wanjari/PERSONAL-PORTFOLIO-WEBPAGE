#DESCRIPTION ABOUT PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBPAGE


The Vidit Wanjari Portfolio Website is a sleek and responsive personal web portfolio designed to showcase my academic background, technical projects, and career interests as a B.Tech Computer Science student at Symbiosis Institute of Technology. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this portfolio serves as a digital representation of my skills, interests, and work in modern web development, machine learning, and UI/UX design.

From the moment users visit the site, they are greeted with a clean interface and an engaging introduction. The home page immediately highlights my identity and educational affiliation, while the navigation bar allows smooth scrolling across key sections—Home, Projects, About, and Contact—for an intuitive user experience.

About Section
The About Me section presents a concise overview of who I am—a motivated, detail-oriented Computer Science student with a strong passion for programming, problem-solving, and real-world application of technology. It reflects my curiosity and eagerness to collaborate, learn new technologies, and contribute meaningfully to the tech ecosystem. The website emphasizes responsiveness, making it accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones with consistent aesthetics and readability.

Projects Section
The Projects section is the core highlight of this portfolio. It uses a modern card-based layout to present key software projects that reflect my technical competencies and interests. Each project includes a short, actionable description along with a link to explore more. Featured projects include:

NGO Donation App: A secure platform for donating to verified NGOs, integrating credibility scoring using Google Reviews and offering transparency and trust for donors.

Weather Prediction App (ML-based): Utilizes historical weather data and machine learning algorithms to forecast weather conditions for up to six months.

Calculator: A responsive web calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating clean UI logic.

Instagram Clone: A UI-focused clone of Instagram featuring a responsive post layout to replicate social media interfaces.

Spotify Clone: A basic clone of the Spotify music app interface, inspired by modern streaming app design.

Each project demonstrates my hands-on development experience and interest in blending front-end design with functional backend logic.
